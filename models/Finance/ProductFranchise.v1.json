    "description": "Within BIAH, a Franchise is a level of aggregation of product groups that follow mainly three specific characteristics: Antiparasitics, Vaccines and Therapeutics. \nProducts in each franchise follow a different “sale” model and thus require a different level of investment, training and marketing. \nWhen customers consider their product needs for treatment and prevention of their patients, they also think in terms of these Franchises. As a result, AH companies not just sell a product/brand, but must sell a portfolio of products and services across species to be competitive. Franchises allow products to be aggregated in relevant groups mirroring these existing market segments within the AH industry. \nLast but not least development of products is performed following the Franchises. Therefore the R&D teams are currently structured mirroring the same relevant customer segments.\n\nFor specific Business Segments there are slightly differing characteristics needed which is why we’ve got more than three different Product Franchises maintained.\n\nWithin HP and Biopharmaceuticals Product Franchises are currently not used (only dummy franchises exist).",
