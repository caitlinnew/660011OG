INDICATIONs are not actively managed at this level (except for INDICATIONs for BUSINESS SEGMENT Veterinary Public Health) and thus not highlighted in a LOCAL BRAND DETAIL.\nFor BUSINESS UNIT Human Pharma, the LOCAL BRAND DETAIL is a LOCAL BRAND + INDICATION, as LOCAL BRAND content and activities are often INDICATION-specific. The Target SPECIES is per definition always human, thus not a differentiator in the BUSINESS UNIT Human Pharma, thus not highlighted in a LOCAL BRAND DETAIL.\n\nA LOCAL BRAND DETAIL has no link to MATERIAL, as the LOCAL BRAND holds the link to MATERIAL.",
