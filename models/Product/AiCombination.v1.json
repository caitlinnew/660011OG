The SUBSTANCE naming only the Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) moiety is used for definition of an AI COMBINATION, i.e. without salt form and hydrate form. Salt form and hydrate form are provided in the PRODUCT COMPOSITION.\n[Source: Eudralex - The Rules Governing Medicinal Products in the European Union, Volume 2C: Regulatory Guidelines, A GUIDELINE ON SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS (SmPC) Rev. 2, Sep. 2009; http://ec.europa.eu/health/files/eudralex/vol-2/c/smpc_guideline_rev2_en.pdf]\n\nSPECIFIED SUBSTANCEs are used for AI COMBINATIONs of PRODUCT CATEGORY immunological (i.e. vaccines), as only the SPECIFIED SUBSTANCE specifies the active immunological ingredient (antigen), type and/or the strain of the antigen, live status. This information is relevant for the GLOBAL BRAND. The SUSTANCE only specifies antigen and live status and is therefore not sufficient.\n[source: project VERITAS Product - Phase 1, Design & Build phase, Oct 2018 - Oct 2019]",
