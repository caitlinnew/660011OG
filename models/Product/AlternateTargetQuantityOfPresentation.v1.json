The conversion rule Quantity 1 [UoM] = Quantity 2 [Alternate UoM] can be rearranged to calculate a conversion factor: 1 [UoM] = (Quantity 2 / Quantity 1) [Alternate UoM].\nQuantity 2 is the conversion factor numerator; here called Alternate Target Quantity.\nQuantity 1 is the conversion factor denominator; here called denominator, not Target Quantity.\nThe Alternate Target Quantity UoM or UoP are attributes of this object.\nThe Target Quantity UoM is an attribute of the object \"PRODUCT COMPOSITION\".",
