    "description": "The GLOBAL BRAND is the commercial name under which Boehringer Ingelheim would like to sell an AI COMBINATION or a branded DEVICE for at least one INDICATION [relevant in BUSINESS UNIT Human Pharma] for at least one TARGET SPECIES [relevant in BUSINESS UNIT Animal Health]. With this, it is the preferred Brand Name.\nThe GLOBAL BRAND Name is often a BI-proprietary name, i.e. a trade mark protected name, but trade mark protection is not a prerequisite for a GLOBAL BRAND Name. Often, a GLOBAL BRAND Name is only partly trade mark protected, e.g. in Solo-Jec 10 only the term Solo-Jec may be trade mark protected, but not the 10. Also, as there is no global trade mark authority, trade mark protection only applies locally or regionally and therefore may differ between COUNTRYs.\nThe GLOBAL BRAND does not indicate a large geographical footprint or large revenues. It is just the \"mother in headquarters\" of all corresponding LOCAL BRANDs in the COUNTRYs. It is used to consolidate the many different LOCAL BRAND Names under one Brand Name, the GLOBAL BRAND Name.\nThe GLOBAL BRAND Name as maintained in the object GLOBAL BRAND is never printed. PRINT information (also called Label information, Artwork) is managed as Layer 3 of the BI data model for Product (GLOBAL SKU).",

One term is always abbreviated in the same way, independent of the remaining available characters.\nThe Global Brand Name is always maintained in English.
