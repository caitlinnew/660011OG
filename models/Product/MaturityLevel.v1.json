    "description": "The MATURITY LEVEL describes the maturity of the data content of a data object. Every data object (not its individual attributes) of the first three levels of the Logical Data Model for Product, i.e. Strategic -, Regulatory - and Scientific Product Description has exactly one MATURITY LEVEL.\nThe MATURITY LEVEL is used to define (a) whether or not individual attribute content can still be changed and (b) which child objects can reference the data object at this MATURITY LEVEL.\nThe MATURITY LEVELs are defined as abstract Maturity Levels 1, 2, 3, 4. This allows to match those MATURITY LEVEL to the BUSINESS UNIT-specfic Development Milestones.\nThe MATURITY LEVEL is not to be confused with the GLOBAL LIFE CYCLE STATUS.\nThe GLOBAL LIFE CYCLE STATUS describes per object its position in its life cylce and therefore its relevance for the BI corporation (e.g. active, inactive). The MATURITY LEVEL describes within a GLOBAL LIFE CYCLE STATUS the maturity of its data content.",
