Contribution statements at Product Group level for a specific Business Field must add up to 100 % of the respective Business Field’s Contribution Statement on the level of Contribution II.\nIn general, Product Groups serve the purpose to enable the businesses’ portfolio management by financial steering. PNRs at the level of Product Group are the basis for assessment and allocation of resources and funds. However, some Product Groups can be created for special cases where financial steering is not required and/or not appropriate (e.g. various non-significant products are grouped together in one Product Group).”",
