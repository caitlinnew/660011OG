    "description": "A DEVICE is a DRUG PRODUCT-free item of the Boehringer Ingelheim product portfolio for which Boehringer holds specific knowledge and/or labels it as a Boehringer product (see detailed descriptions below).\nThe DEVICE achieves its principal effect mainly through physical approach. It does not achieve its principal effect by pharmacological, immunological or metabolic means in or on the human body or animal, but it may be assisted in its function by such means.\nA DEVICE is an instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in vitro reagent, software, material or other similar or related article, including any component, part, or accessory for one of the following purposes\na) diagnosis, prevention, monitoring, prediction, prognosis, treatment or alleviation of disease, \nb) diagnosis, monitoring, treatment, alleviation of, or compensation for, an injury or disability,\nc) investigation, replacement or modification of the anatomy or of a physiological or pathological process or state (affecting the structure or function of human or animal body),\nd) providing information by means of in vitro examination of specimens derived from the human body or animal, including organ, blood and tissue donations, \ne) Products specifically intended for the cleaning, disinfection or sterilization of devices\nIf a DEVICE is regulated as a MEDICAL DEVICE for a TARGET SPECIES in a JURISDICTION it specializes into a MEDICAL DEVICE. Otherwise it remains the generalized DEVICE.\n[Source: Karin Herzog, Information Owner DEVICE, 12 JUN 2018]\n\nSome DEVICEs have to be sterile for use. They are either packed sterile in a PRIMARY PACKAGING or they are sterilized prior to use. For the first option, the PRIMARY PACKAGING is not described in detail and is not managed as PRIMARY PACKAGING in Boehringer, as Boehringer purchases sterile DEVICEs already sterile packed, e.g. sterile single-use syringes, sterile single-use alcohol swab, sterile single-use vial adaptor. Therefore DEVICE includes sterile (primary packed) Devices, without separate description of the sterile packaging.\nThe penetration of an item into the body of a human or an animal does not make the item a DEVICE. For example, ear tags pinched through ears of vaccinated animals are not a DEVICE, but AUXILIARY GOODs, as there is no causality between the item and a disease, injury or disability.\nDEVICEs for which Boehringer holds no specific knowledge nor labels it as a Boehringer product are not managed as DEVICE, but as AUXILIARY GOOD. For example, unbranded empty syringes or protective gloves for veterinary use are managed as AUXILIARY GOOD, as Boehringer does not manage nor need to report any MEDICAL DEVICE NOMENCLATURE for these items. That is the manufacturer's responsibility.",
