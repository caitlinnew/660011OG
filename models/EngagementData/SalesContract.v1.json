    "description": "A sales contract is a contract between BI and a customer (e.g. a wholesaler, a group purchasing organization (GPO), a government organization, ..) which contains terms and conditions valid for the sales of BI products to that customer or his clients / members. Included (per product / SKU / \"revenue generating material\") might be conditions like e.g. prices, chargebacks (for wholesaler) or rebates (for GPO, government) which the contract partner may request BI to apply or refund for indirect sales (to the wholesaler's customers / to the GPO members / to the people covered by the government program).\nThe rules and regulations belonging to a government program are also considered to be a sales contract (which BI has \"signed\" by participating in it).",
