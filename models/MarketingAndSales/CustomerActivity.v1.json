    "title": "CUSTOMER ACTIVITY",
    "type": "object",
    "description": "A CUSTOMER ACTIVITY is any activity of / with / for a Customer (mainly HCP, HCO) which is of interest for M+S or Medicine purposes.\nIf more than one Customer is participating in an activity (e.g. Sales Rep call (INTERACTION) with several customers), then this activity will be divided into several CUSTOMER ACTIVITYs: one for each Customer. (The connection between the many-customer activity and the one-customer activities is rendered by the “is part of” relationship between customer activities.) \nAn CUSTOMER ACTIVITY may be about several topics, but not about more than one topic from the TOPIC TYPEs (e.g GLOBAL BRAND, LOCAL PRODUCT). If an activity is about more than one topic out of these (e.g. a Sales Rep call about several Products or Brands), then this activity will be divided into several CUSTOMER ACTIVITYs: one for each Brand / Product. (The connection between the many-product activity and the one-product activities is rendered by the “is part of” relationship between customer activities.) \nA CUSTOMER ACTIVITY may contain a number of single steps: this is rendered by the \"is step of\" relationship between CUSTOMER ACTIVITYs. For example, if a customer visits a BI website (this visit being an INTERACTION), he may click different pieces of that website - reading an article, watching a video, reading another article, looking at a slide deck, ... each of these being an INTERACTION of their own. Thus the \"customer's journey\" can be tracked.\nSimilar to the \"is step of\" relationship between CUSTOMER ACTIVITYs is the \"triggers\" relationship: While the first is rendering just the sequence of steps, the latter says that the \"triggering\" activity leads to / implies the \"triggered\" activity. (E.g. an approved email (INTERACTION) sent to a customer leads to a REQUEST from customer to be visited (INTERACTION) by an MSL, which then produces a FEEDBACK from the customer as well as a REQUEST to have a number of patient brochures. \nA CUSTOMER ACTIVITY may be about a GLOBAL BRAND as well as about a SECONDARY PACKED DRUG PRODUCT / GLOBAL SKU: e.g. a CUSTOMER ACTIVITY of the type REQUEST might be about the GLOBAL BRAND Trajenta and the (requested) SECONDARY PACKED DRUG PRODUCT / GLOBAL SKU could be the \"Patient Brochure Trajenta\".",
