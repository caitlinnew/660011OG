    "description": "A sale is a transaction between a seller and a buyer in which the seller provides tangible or intangible assets to the buyer and in exchange the buyer provides tangible or intangible assets to the seller. The most frequent version in short: The seller provides goods, and the buyer pays money. \nThe sale is meant to also include returns. In this case the directions of both goods and money flow are reversed, also meaning that the numbers are turned to be negative: E.g. if 2,000 units are returned, the Quantity will be \"-2,000\", and the Amounts will be negative, too.",
