It defines the target disease or condition for which an AI COMBINATION or a DEVICE is under investigation.\nIt contains two Attributes of the THERAPEUTIC INDICATION, Indication as disease/symptom/procedure and Comorbidity. Both are coded by an INDICATION CODE of one Code Type and one Hierarchy Level.\nIt is used to assign an AI COMBINATION to a BUSINESS SEGMENT. For such assignment, only the two of the five attributes of the THERAPEUTIC INDICATION are required. Also, the other three attributes are not necessarily known at the Start of Development.",
