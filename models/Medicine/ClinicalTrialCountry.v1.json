    "description": "A CLINICAL TRIAL COUNTRY describes the contribution of patients from a specific country to a clinical trial. The patients are assumed to be \"supplied\" from one geographical country and their contribution is managed by a designated CML. This CML does not necessarily need to be located within the country supplying the patients.\nThe contribution brings together a set of information (planning and monitoring relevant) from different areas. It is in general always a pair of CML/Country. Via the CML role assignment, the responsible company can be derived.\nThis combination implies which BI Company is responsible for planning and tracking on external costs for the countries/sites it is assigned to. In a regional setting, the OPU with regional scope (like e.g. RA for South America) may take on financial responsibility for a multitude of countries in SA during a given clinical trial.\nIt is to be noted, however, that the monitoring responsibility of the CML might not correspond to the financial responsibility. It might be decided to have one regional CML only or one CML for two countries and one for each remaining country.",
