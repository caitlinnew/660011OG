The product itself does not need to be authorised/approved and this information should be reflected in 2.4 Authorisation status (medicinal product level) and in 4.6.4. Authorisation status (package level), when applicable.\n    \n- Authorised Medicinal Product also covers:\n- traditional use registration for herbal medicinal products (Article 16a of Directive 2001/83/EC);\n- simplified registration for homeopathic medicinal products (Article 14 of Directive 2001/83/EC);\n- medicinal products within the scope of Article 5 of Directive 2001/83/EC i.e. 'Named patient use' falling under Article 5(1) and 'EU Distribution Procedure' under Article 5(2);\n- parallel distribution/parallel import of medicinal products (Article 76(3) and (4) of Directive 2001/83/EC);\n- medicinal products authorised outside the European Economic Area (EEA) or following a non-EU procedure;\n- extemporaneous Medicinal products (e.g. medicinal products prepared in a pharmacy based on a medical prescription such as pharmacy preparations);\n- intermediate products intended for subsequent processing by an authorised manufacturer.\n\nInvestigational medicinal products are not covered in PMS iteration 1.",
