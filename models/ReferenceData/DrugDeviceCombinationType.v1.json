    "description": "As defined in the Directive 2001/83/EC, medicinal products can be marketed for use in combination with a medical device, usually to enable the delivery of the medicine. Information on the medical device, based on the elements described in this section should be provided when the medicinal product is presented in combination with medical devices. Overall, there are two types of combination:\n•\tintegral: the medicinal product and device form a single integrated product e.g. pre-filled syringes and pre-filled pens, certain types of patches for transdermal drug delivery and pre-filled inhalers;\n•\tco-packaged: the medicinal product and the device are separate items contained in the same pack e.g. reusable pen for insulin cartridges, tablet delivery system with controller for pain management.\nIn addition, the device may be combined with the medicinal product and support the pharmacological/metabolic/immunological action of the medicinal product (collagen scaffold). In these cases, the device’s purpose goes beyond the administration and supports the mechanism of action of the medicinal product. These types of devices are considered an integral part of the pharmaceutical product administered to the patient and are not subject to this list.\nClassification of type of a Drug Device Combination towards EMA",
