    "description": "COUNTRY SUBDIVISIONs represent the relevant administrative divisions and dependent territories of a COUNTRY.\nA COUNTRY SUBDIVISION therefore is more granular than a COUNTRY but less granular than the detail componentes of an ADDRESS.\nThe primary SUBDIVISIONs of a COUNTRY are defined according to ISO 3166-2. This is an international standard of short and unique alphanumeric codes.\nThere may be regional standards like FIPS (US) and NUTS (EU) which are (mostly) compatible with the existing SUBDIVISIONs defined in the ISO standard. These standards may extend the subdivision hierarchy with additional levels (for which ISO has no codes defined)\nBI specific extensions of COUNTRY SUBDIVISION are possible but they should adhere as much as possible to the official definitions of administrative units of the respective COUNTRYs.\nCountry subdivision by ISO-3166-2\nsee https://unece.org/trade/uncefact/unlocode-country-subdivisions-iso-3166-2",
