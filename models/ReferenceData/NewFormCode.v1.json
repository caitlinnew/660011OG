    "description": "The New Form Code (NFC) is a standardized classification of dose forms, which also provides some information on primary packaging. The New Form Code classification is based on three letters:\n\n1.The first letter differentiates between forms for systemic and topical effect, site of application, and also between long-acting and ordinary forms.\n\n2.The second letter indicates the general form of medication and is independent of the first letter. This allows to select all liquids independent of the site of application, all tablets independent of ordinary or long-acting effect and systemic or topical use, etc. For the distinction of the specific form the third letter is to be used together with the second letter.\n\n3.The third letter subdivides the general form of medication as defined by the second letter into more specific dose forms. Therefore, the third letter can only be used together with the second letter. Normally, the third letter that provides the most specific information is used.\n\nFor details, see NEW FORM CODE CLASSIFICATION (ephmra.org). A thorough understanding of the NFC definition details, especially of Rules 1-4, is critical for its accurate usage.",
