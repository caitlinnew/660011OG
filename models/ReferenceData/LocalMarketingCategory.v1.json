    "description": "The local marketing category is used in order to group multiple SKUs. It needs to be aligned across the entire customer engagement process, from the market mix planning to the sales execution. This information is also required for analysis after sales campaigns are completed.\nThe local marketing category is required to appropriately create and manage pricelists, promotions and rebate contracts. It is also required to calculate promotions and rebates on product group level. It is used as part of the revenue management processes for the Vistex Add On in the GBS united system. The ability to categorize products prevents us from creating promotions and/or rebates at the individual SKU level.",
