    "description": "Medicinal products may consist of two pharmaceutical products that correspond with two different administrable dose forms (e.g. hard capsule and cream) that form individual entities which do not need combining for administering to the patient.\nTwo authorised products with different administrable dose forms are used to treat certain illnesses simultaneously. The two products are offered to the patient in one package for convenience reasons. Alternatively, they could be handled also as two totally separate products. Example: vaginal cream and vaginal suppositories to treat illnesses caused by fungi.",
