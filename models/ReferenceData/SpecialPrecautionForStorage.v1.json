    "description": "This list contains the description of the possible storage and/or transport conditions for a medicinal product under which it can be kept during its shelf life.\nThese are based on evaluation of the stability studies undertaken on the finished product. Details of the conditions recommended for these stability studies are included in the relevant CHMP/ICH Guidelines. The storage conditions must be possible for the user to follow and the statements are therefore restricted to those achievable in practice.\nThis list is used to describe the conditions under which the shelf life was established and guaranteed. The information is used in product information (SPC, PIL, labelling).",
