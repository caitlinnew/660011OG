    "title": "MARKETING STATUS",
    "type": "object",
    "description": "This list describes the marketing status of a packaged medicinal product. Sales status considers the concepts of placing in the market and market cessation. The terms “actual marketing” and “placing on the market” are defined as when the medicinal product is “released into the distribution chain” e.g. out of control the Marketing authorisation holder. The “cessation of placing on the market” is defined, by analogy to the placing on the market, as the “cessation of release into the distribution chain” with the consequence that the concerned product may no longer be available for the supply to the patients. Therefore, the marketing status describes the date when a package medicinal product is available on the distribution chain and on the market (placing in the market) or the date as of which it is no longer available which is considered the date of the last release into the distribution chain (market cessation). In the case of centralised authorised products (CAPs), the sales status is reported per each individual EU/EEA country.\nReport to EMA whether a product is placed on the market or not in an HP IDMP context.",
