    "description": "COLOR is the main color of a tangible item. The values of the Standard filter subset of COLOR contain only values for single colors. Beyond the values marked as standard, there may be nuances (e.g. light red, middle red, dark red). Color mixtures should be avoided, iv possible (e.g. red-brown). Also, if the tangible item has several colors, only the main color is named as this object only has single colors (e.g. green), no combination of colours (e.g. green and black).\nCOLOR does not include information on Transparency of a tangible item, as Transparency is independent of COLOR (e.g. brown transparent). Therefore, COLOR and Transparency can be managed separately.",
