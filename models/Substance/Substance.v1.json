    "description": "The SUBSTANCE definition of Boehringer is close to the substance defitinition in the ISO standard, excerpt is given below. \nIn brief a substance is described by its unchangeable scientific properties. For substance types refer to ISO standard below. In addition Boehringer accepts Virus Strains listed as Substances. \nISO DTS 19844 definition: \nAll medicinal products consist of substances; these substances can be active ingredients, excipients, or packaging materials. There are two fundamental levels of information described in the standard, a substance level and what is called a specified substance level. Both levels are included in the more generic concept of an ingredient. At the substance level, substances are defined based on inherent attributes rather than use or method of manufacture. At the specified substance level, four separate groups of elements provide additional information. In order to define or distinguish material either at a substance or specified substance level, a number ofattributes should be taken into consideration:\n• For chemicals, the molecular structure is only captured at the substance level.\n• For proteins, the amino acid sequence, sites and type of glycosylation, and the presence and position of disulfide bonds will only be captured at the substance level.\n• For nucleic acids, the sequence, type of sugar and linkage will only be captured at the substance level.\n• For other polymers, the monomers used to synthesise the polymer, the structural repeating units, the molecular weight and/or a property related to molecular weight (i.e. viscosity), the source of naturally derived polymers and any modifications that irreversibly alters the molecular structure of a polymer will be captured at the substance level. \n• For structurally diverse material, taxonomic, anatomical and fractionation information, properties related to the underlying molecular structure of the material, and modifications that alter the underlying molecular structure will be captured at the substance level. \n• Mixture substance consists of a simple combination of single substances that are either isolated together or are the result of the same synthetic process. The biological source of the mixture is also captured where relevant at the substance level. Proportions are not captured at the substance level. It should be noted that a mixture substance description should only include the substances that are generally or consistently present in the material. This excludes impurities and degradants.\"\n\nSKU relation: \nA Substance defines the same as a GLOBAL SKU for Substance product stages.",
