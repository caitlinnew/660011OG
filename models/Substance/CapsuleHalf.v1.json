    "description": "A CAPSULE is the relatively stable shell encapsulating an INTERMEDIATE DRUG PRODUCT. \nThe two main types of CAPSULEs are: \n(1) Hard-shelled capsules, which contain dry, powdered ingredients or miniature pellets. These CAPSULEs are made in two halves: a smaller-diameter body that is filled and then sealed using a larger-diameter cap. \n(2) Soft-shelled capsules, primarily used for oils and for active ingredients that are dissolved or suspended in oil. These are made during the formulation of the DRUG PRODUCT.\n[Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsule_(pharmacy); retrieved 04 MAR 2019]\nIn this model, a CAPSULE may be a Capsule body, capsule cap or an entire capsule, as specified by the CAPSULE TYPE. This allows the management of both hard and soft capsules using one object.\nIn contrast to a SPECIFIED SUBSTANCE, a CAPSULE has a defined PHYSICAL APPEARANCE characterized by the CAPSULE SIZE and is therefore maintained as a specialized object. This applies to hard and soft CAPSULEs.",
